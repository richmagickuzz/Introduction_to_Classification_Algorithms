# Introduction to Classification Algorithms
# This two-module notebook consists of an introduction to reviewing, analyzing, and classifying physics data. Classification algorithms are critical supervised learning techniques in data science. In a classification problem, we use the information contained in the data to predict the class of the sample. The first notebook in this module will have students analyze a data file containing data for various refractive indexes of optical materials. A suitable classification method could help data scientists determine essential features and boost existing models. This module lets the student observe a natural classification algorithm from a real physics problem.
